### 👋 Hi, I'm Caroline

I started out teaching mathematics before diving into the fascinating world of data.

Naturally curious and passionate about language, I now work as a data scientist specializing in NLP at the startup **U change**.
I design tools that listen, sort, and explain — all from vast amounts of messy text data.

My projects blend analytical rigor, language processing, and a keen eye for detail.
### 🧪 This portfolio showcases my personal projects.

Because personal projects fuel professional growth — and vice versa.
Exploring, learning, failing, succeeding: here, everything is a reason to grow.

Welcome to my world — part algorithm, part poetry...

**Automatic customer review classification and interactive visualization via Streamlit.**

This NLP project identifies various issue types in Amazon reviews (damaged product, non-compliance, etc.) using a pipeline that combines TF-IDF, semantic features, and XGBoost.

Results can be explored through a dashboard with filters, charts, and data export options.
